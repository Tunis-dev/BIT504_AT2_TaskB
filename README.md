# BIT504_AT2_TaskB
Original pong game - shared to a repository in Eclipse - Code was committed and pushed to remote depository where github created master branch.
From GitHub the 2 master branches (local and remote)local branch master pulled to remote master branch - as the "model code"
A second branch from the master branch - Experiment1 - became the working project to test changes before staging, committing and pushing to the remote repository.
From the remote repository, the experiment branch was compared to the master branch for compatibility / ability to be merged (pulled) to the master branch.
Pull request was approved and Experiment1 became the master branch.
A third branch Experiment 2 was created to trial further changes, changes committed and pushed to remote repostory.
